When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository may be used when working on a laptop in a different location, than the normal workspace.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I would want changes to be pulled manually to ensure that things I do not want to be pulled are not pulled.
